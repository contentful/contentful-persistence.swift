> An integration to simplify persisting data from [Contentful][1] to a local CoreData database; built on top of the official Contentful [Swift Library][2]. This library specifically uses the [`/sync` endpoint][7] of the Content Delivery API to synchronize all content in a Contentful space to device.

**What is Contentful?**

[Contentful][1] provides a content infrastructure for digital teams to power content in websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.

## Getting started

### Prerequisite

Before getting started, it is highly recommended that you familiarize yourself with Apple's CoreData framework as many issues encountered during development may be CoreData specific. Read the [CoreData Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/index.html) and check out other (non-Contentful) examples. 

### Usage 

The `SynchronizationManager` manages the state of your CoreData database and keeps it in sync with the data from your Contentful Space:

```swift
// Tell the library which of your `NSManagedObject` subclasses that conform to `EntryPersistable` should be used when mapping API resonses to CoreData entities.
let entryTypes = [Author.self, Category.self, Post.self]

// Initialize the data store and it's schema.
let store = CoreDataStore(context: self.managedObjectContext)
let persistenceModel = PersistenceModel(spaceType: SyncInfo.self, assetType: Asset.self, entryTypes: entryTypes)

// Initialize the Contentful.Client with a persistenceIntegration which will receive messages about changes when calling `sync methods`
self.client = Client(spaceId: "<YOUR_SPACE_ID>", accessToken: "<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>")

// Create the manager.
self.syncManager = SynchronizationManager(client: self.client,
                                          localizationScheme: LocalizationScheme.all, // Save data for all locales your space supports.
                                          persistenceStore: self.store, 
                                          persistenceModel: persistenceModel)

// Sync with the API. 
self.syncManager.sync { _ in
  do {
    // Fetch all `Posts` from CoreData
    let post: Post? = try self.store.fetchAll(type: Post.self, predicate: NSPredicate(value: true))
  } catch {
    // Handle error thrown by CoreData fetches.
  }
}
```

## Define your `CoreData` model

To make your model classes work with contentful-persistence.swift you will need to either conform to `AssetPersistable` for Contentful Assets, or `EntryPersistable` for Contentful entry types.

Then you will need to make the corresponding model in your projects `xcdatamodel` file. Both `EntryPersistable` and `AssetPersistable` types must have a _non-optional_ `id` property as well as optional `localeCode`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` properties.

**NOTE:** Optionality on CoreData entities is a bit different than Swift optionality. Optionality on CoreData entities means that the property may be absent when a save-to-database operation is performed. To configure a property's optionality, open the "Data Model Inspector" in Xcode's "Utilities" right sidebar and toggle the "Optional" checkbox:

![](Screenshots/CoreDataOptionality.png)

The mapping of Contentful fields to your data model entities will be derived automatically, but you can also customize it, by implementing the `static func mapping() -> [FieldName: String]?` on your class.

Below is an example of a model class. 

```swift
import Foundation
import CoreData
import ContentfulPersistence
import Contentful

// The following @objc attribute is only necessary if your xcdatamodel Default configuration doesn't have your module
// name prepended to the Swift class. To enable removing the @objc attribute, change the Class for your entity to `ModuleName.Post`
@objc(Post) 
class Post: NSManagedObject, EntryPersistable {
      
    // The identifier of the corresponding Content Type in Contentful.
    static let contentTypeId = "post"

    // Properties of the `sys` object of Contentful resources.
    @NSManaged var id: String
    @NSManaged var localeCode: String?
    @NSManaged var createdAt: Date? 
    @NSManaged var updatedAt: Date?

    // Custom fields on the content type.
    @NSManaged var body: String?
    @NSManaged var comments: NSNumber?
    // NOTE: Unlike date fields in sys properties, this library can't store `Date` for custom fields.
    // Use `String` and map to date after fetching from CoreData
    @NSManaged var customDateField: String? 
    @NSManaged var date: Date?
    @NSManaged var slug: String?
    @NSManaged var tags: Data?
    @NSManaged var title: String?
    @NSManaged var authors: NSOrderedSet?
    @NSManaged var category: NSOrderedSet?
    @NSManaged var theFeaturedImage: Asset?

    // Define the mapping from the fields on your Contentful.Entry to your model class. 
    // In the below example, only the `title`, `date` and `author` fields and `featuredImage` link will be populated.
    static func fieldMapping() -> [FieldName: String] {
        return [
            "title": "title",
            "featuredImage": "theFeaturedImage",
            "author": "authors"
            "date": "date"
        ]    
    }
}
```

**HINT:** For **array-based field types** (like `Short text, list`), use the type `Binary Data` in the data model, and the type `Data?` (e.g. `var tags: Data?`) in the Swift code. To access the actual array contents, unpack the `Data` field with `NSKeyedUnarchiver`, e.g.:

```swift
extension Post {

    var theTags: [String]? {
        guard let tagsData = self.tags else { return nil }
        return NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveObject(with: tagsData) as? [String]
    }
}
```

## Installation

### CocoaPods installation

[CocoaPods][5] is the dependency manager for Objective-C and Swift, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like the ContentfulPersistence in your projects.

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.3'
use_frameworks!

target :MyApp do
  pod 'ContentfulPersistenceSwift', '~> 0.13.0'
end
```

### Carthage installation

You can also use [Carthage][6] for integration by adding the following to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "contentful/contentful.swift" ~> 0.13.0
```

## Documentation

For further information, check out the [Developer Documentation][4] or browse the [API documentation][3]. The latter can also be loaded into Xcode as a Docset.

## Contributing and development

To get started contributing, clone the project, `cd` into the root directory and run the following: `make setup_env`.

```bash
make setup_env
carthage bootstrap --platform all
```

This command will install all the development dependencies necessary to build the project, and execute the tests. To run the tests from the command line, execute `make test`. Tests should also all run directly from the Xcode app.
